```

The bridge is the central piece. It owns:

- **Session discovery** — scans `~/.claude/projects/` and presents a flat list across all your repos.
- **Process lifecycle** — spawns `claude -p --resume <id>` per turn; reaps idle subprocesses; enforces single-writer semantics so a desktop terminal and the phone can't simultaneously corrupt the same JSONL.
- **Transport** — HTTP for control plane, WebSocket for the per-session event stream.
- **Auth** — Tailscale identity headers (preferred), bearer token (fallback), loopback-dev (in-development convenience).
- **Permissions** — claude can't prompt the user directly in `--print` mode, so the bridge runs a tiny MCP stdio server that claude calls via `--permission-prompt-tool`. That server posts to the bridge, which forwards the prompt to the phone over WebSocket and waits for a tap.
- **File watching + git** — chokidar watches the session's cwd and emits `file_changed` over WebSocket; `git diff` provides the cumulative session diff against the baseline captured at first spawn.

The mobile app is intentionally thin — a presentation layer for the normalized event stream.

## Key design decisions

### Session = JSONL file on disk

The unit of conversation is the file Claude Code already writes in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`. Both the desktop terminal and our bridge resume sessions through `--resume <uuid>`, so:

- No bridge-specific session storage.
- Continuity across devices for free — any Claude Code invocation (interactive or headless, desktop or our bridge) appends to the same file.
- Multi-user is constrained by who can read those JSONL files (file-system permissions on the desktop) rather than a custom auth system.

### Per-turn subprocess, not long-lived process

`claude -p` exits after each turn even with `--input-format stream-json`. We don't fight that. The bridge:

- Spawns `claude -p --resume <id>` on each user message.
- Pipes the message in via stdin (stream-json line).
- Reads stream-json events from stdout, normalizes them to `AgentEvent`, broadcasts to WebSocket subscribers.
- Lets the subprocess exit naturally on `result`.

This means slightly higher latency per turn (claude's cold start) but radically simpler lifecycle. The idle reaper exists mostly to clean up sessions that errored mid-turn.

### Single-writer guarantee

Two `claude` processes writing to the same JSONL would corrupt history. The bridge:

- At startup of each session, scans `ps` for live `claude` processes (with `--resume <id>` in argv, or running with the session's cwd as their working directory).
- Refuses to spawn if a desktop-owned process is detected, sends `session_busy` to the phone.
- Offers **Take ownership** — the phone can SIGTERM the foreign PID(s) and claim the session.

### MCP permission tool for approvals

In `--print` mode there's no TTY, so claude's built-in approval prompt doesn't run. Instead:

- The bridge spawns claude with `--mcp-config <inline-json>` registering a `rove` MCP server.
- The server has a single tool: `permission_prompt`.
- When claude wants to use a non-allowlisted tool (Bash, Edit, etc.), it calls `mcp__rove__permission_prompt` with `{tool_name, input, tool_use_id}`.
- The MCP server (a stdio process spawned by claude) HTTP-POSTs the bridge's `/internal/permission` endpoint with an internal one-time token.
- The bridge emits a `permission_request` AgentEvent over WebSocket → mobile shows the approval sheet.
- Mobile sends `{type: 'approval', toolUseId, decision}` back over the WebSocket.
- The bridge resolves the pending request, replies to the MCP server, which returns the decision to claude, which then runs (or refuses) the tool.

`updatedInput` in the MCP response echoes the original input unmodified. Claude's schema requires it to be an object — we don't currently let the user edit the tool input from the phone before approving, though the protocol supports it.

### Normalized event stream

Every agent driver translates its CLI's native output into the same `AgentEvent` shape. The mobile app speaks only that shape — never sees raw claude / codex / aider output. This is the seam that makes adding a new agent a per-driver task rather than a UI rewrite.

See [`docs/WIRE_PROTOCOL.md`](WIRE_PROTOCOL.md) for the exact schema.

## Non-goals

- **Hosting agents in the cloud.** This project's value is that nothing runs on someone else's infrastructure. If you want cloud convenience, use Happy or similar.
- **A perfect terminal emulator on phone.** We're a phone-native chat client, not an `xterm.js` shell. Use Blink or Termux + tmux + SSH if you want that.
- **Editing tool inputs before approval.** Possible to add (the MCP `updatedInput` field is exactly for this), not built yet.
- **Multi-tenant SaaS.** Each user runs the bridge on their own machine, joins their own tailnet, has their own data. The project is BYO infrastructure.
